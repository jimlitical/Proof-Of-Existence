My project enables one to show pictures and timestamp them on a blockchain.

It's basically the proof of existence dapp but it has some differences. 

It doesn't use the address to map to a photo but rather a photo maps to an owner and a timestamp.

The project enables one to take a picture and timestamp it forever. One situation I see this being useful for is when someone goes to a pawn shop to get their items back. The pawn shop doesn't want to risk them saying the shop damaged them so they take a picture of the item w/ the happy owner next to a completely undamaged item and put it in the blockchain for extra measure. 

My project takes the SHA256 hash and stores that as the key for the owner and timestamp struct I made.
